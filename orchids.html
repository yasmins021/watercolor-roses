        <p>
            Orchids are popular houseplants and although there are countless species, they all have similar physical characteristics. 
            Orchids are easy to spot because of their arcs of branches, called spikes, covered with softly colored blooms in solid colors or speckles.
             Their petals and sepals (innermost petals) are typically found in groups of three. The bottom petal, usually called a lip or labellum, is shaped like that to host pollinators like bees if grown outdoors. Depending on the variety, an orchid's petals can have ruffled, shaped, or notched edges. Orchid leaves are coated with a heavy waxy film to prevent water loss. 
            Some orchids are faster-growing than others which can require more frequent repotting.

        <h2 class="mb-3 description">02. PLANT CARE</h2>
        <p>
            When you first obtain your orchid, it will likely be healthy and in bloom.
             However, many gift orchids are potted in the wrong conditions for long-term growth.
              They are usually sitting in plastic containers and packed with moss around the roots.
               In nature, orchids typically grow on trees, and their roots are water-gathering organs that need fresh airflow to remain healthy.
                Orchids with wet roots are susceptible to root rot and other problems. However, while your orchid's current container might not be ideal, never repot an orchid while it is in bloom, which could last a few weeks or more. 
                Instead of repotting, it's better to hold off on watering.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the bloom is over, it's time to shift your thinking from short-term care to long-term maintenance. Most growers snip off the old flower spike near the base. 
            (Some experts retain the spikes hoping for a rebloom, which sometimes does happen).
             Also at this time, you can repot your orchid into a more suitable container with the right growing medium.
        </p>
        <p> 
            To grow an orchid, you have to think like an orchid.
             The golden rule for orchid success is to duplicate the plant's natural conditions as closely as possible.
              In nature, most orchids are epiphytes, meaning they grow on other objects, clinging to rough bark or even stone.
               The showy orchids favored by most people are usually either phalaenopsis hybrids or dendrobium hybrids.
