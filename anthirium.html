        <p>
            Anthurium is a genus of around 1,000 species of perennial plants native to Central America, northern South America, and the Caribbean. While they can be grown outdoors in the garden in warm climates, anthurium is more often grown as houseplants by enthusiasts willing to put forth the effort for a plant that can be fussy. Some species are highly prized for their bright, exotic flowers, while others are grown mostly for their foliage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flowering varieties of these plants are distinctive for their multicolored spathes and red or yellow tail-like flower spikes. Other varieties feature large-leaved, deeply veined foliage. Many anthuriums are climbers and all need high humidity and warmth to thrive. They tend to thrive in greenhouses, and no type of anthurium is particularly well-suited for indoor, domestic living without a lot of attention and care.

        <h2 class="mb-3 description">02. PLANT CARE</h2>
        <p>Anthurium plants thrive in bright, indirect light. 
            They do not like exposure to direct sunlight, except in the winter months or in plants that have been carefully acclimated.
             Wild anthuriums generally live in temperatures at or above 60 degrees Fahrenheit and the foliage types prefer temperatures even warmer. 
             If temperatures dip below this level, the plant will suffer.
             </p>
        <p>
            Potted anthuriums prefer a rich but well-draining potting mix that should be kept moist but not wet. 
            A potting mix tailored for orchids, with a few handfuls of sand and a few handfuls of peat moss mixed in, is ideal.
        </p>

        <p>
            In natural settings, many anthurium plants are "epiphytic"â€”they grow on other plants instead of in soil. If your plant fails to support itself, give it a stake or small trellis to climb on.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Repotting should be done whenever the plant fills up its pot with roots. This can occur every year or two when you see "air roots" begin to extend up above the soil level. This is a sign that the plant can be repotted, which is also a good time to propagate new plants.
